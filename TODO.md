##Bugs
- [ ] If you send set of command and quickly follow up with second set of commands while first set is still executing, you don't get new hand before first set is done executing

##Planned features
- [x] When player dies, client should change screen and display "game over" screen
- [ ] When there's only 1 player alive, server should display end screen with scoreboard
- [ ] When player dies or is victorious, server should notify it of outcome
- [ ] Assign player colour to each player. Display all color cards near top edge of screen on server and change background (which one?) of client's chips/sections/buttons
